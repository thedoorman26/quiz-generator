# Overview

This is a TypeScript program that allows a user to create and play quizzes with multiple choice questions. It makes use of asynchronous functions to keep the program running in the background while quizzes are being created or played.

I created this program because I was familiar with JavaScript, but had never used TypeScript before, and I wanted to advance my skillset.

Here's a link to a YouTube demonstration of the software:

# Development Environment

- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Language: TypeScript
- Imported readline/promises for async funtions
- Imported node:process for IO streams

# Useful Websites

Here are a couple of resources that I found helpful while making this project:

- [W3schools typescript tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/)
- [Digital Ocean guide to setting up a TypeScript project](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project)

# Future Work

Some things I'd like to add in the future:

- Quizzes with a different number of choices than 4
- Free response quizzes
- Saving/loading with files
